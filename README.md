# 🚀 PyDataEngi

A hands-on repository exploring practical techniques in **Data Engineering** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python. From data cleaning and transformation to visual storytelling and modular workflows — this project chronicles the journey from messy raw data to polished insights.

## 🔍 Key Topics Covered

- ✅ Missing data handling (NaNs, blanks, conditional filtering)
- 🧹 Text cleaning using regex, mapping, list/str logic
- ⏳ Time-series resampling and rolling window analysis
- 📊 Visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- 🔥 Heatmaps, histograms, line plots, and dashboard-style layouts
- 🧠 Correlation exploration for actionable EDA insights
- 🛠️ Reusable logic for filtering, comparison, and diagnostics

## 📈 Sample Outputs

Visuals generated include:
- Sales trend line plots with rolling averages
- Temperature histograms with KDE overlays
- Feature correlation heatmaps for statistical intuition

_Note: Check `D13EDA6PlotGraphs.py` for a full multi-plot example._

## 🧪 What’s Next

We’re gearing up for **Week 4: Feature Engineering + Mini Pipelines**, covering:
- Transformations (scaling, binning, encoding)
- Feature interaction and selection logic
- Modular pipeline construction for production-ready flows
