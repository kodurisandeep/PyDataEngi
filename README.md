🚀 PyDataEngi
A hands-on repository exploring practical techniques in Data Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. From data cleaning and transformation to visual storytelling and modular workflows — this project chronicles the journey from messy raw data to polished insights.

🔍 Key Topics Covered
- ✅ Missing data handling (NaNs, blanks, conditional filtering)
- 🧹 Text cleaning using regex, mapping, list/str logic
- ⏳ Time-series resampling and rolling window analysis
- 📊 Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- 🔥 Heatmaps, histograms, line plots, and dashboard-style layouts
- 🧠 Correlation exploration for actionable EDA insights
- 🛠️ Reusable logic for filtering, comparison, and diagnostics
- 🧪 Feature creation: derived columns, ratios, flags
- 🧬 Encoding techniques: one-hot, label encoding, mapping
- ⚙️ Configurable ETL scripts using argparse and YAML
- 🔐 Schema validation with Pydantic and manual rules
  
📈 Sample Outputs
Visuals generated include:
- Sales trend line plots with rolling averages
- Temperature histograms with KDE overlays
- Feature correlation heatmaps for statistical intuition
Note: Check D13EDA6PlotGraphs.py for a full multi-plot example.

🧪 Week 4 Progress
We’ve completed the following modules:
- ✅ Feature Creation: derived columns, ratios, flags
- ✅ Encoding Techniques: one-hot, label, mapping
- ✅ Configurable ETL Scripts: argparse and YAML-based flows
- ✅ Schema Validation: Pydantic models and DataFrame audits
  
Coming up next:
- 📦 Compression formats (parquet, gzip, etc.)
- 📋 Logging strategies (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG)
- 🧯 Error handling and recovery logic
- 🧰 Final Project: A complete ETL app that ingests, cleans, analyzes, and outputs
